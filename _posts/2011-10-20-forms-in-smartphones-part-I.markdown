Toyota is known for their manufacturing process. People have [studied] [1] and [emulated] [2] it for years. Recently [Mary and Tom Poppendieck] [3] brought it to [software development] [4].

I assumed Toyota used their renowned manufacturing process to write the software for their vehicles. Henrik's article proved me wrong.

My favorite quote from the article:

> My conclusion after the trip was "well, now I know that there's at least one company in the world that can succeed with the waterfall model" and I decided to stop bashing the waterfall model as hard as I usually do. Now, however, with all the problems Toyota are having, I'm starting to reconsider.
